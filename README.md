# apache-win-build

Build Apache Web Server (and dependencies) on Windows with one command.

Nothing much yet.

Need to setup win-build for the following dependencies first:
    1. zlib [DONE - see zlib-win-build]
    2. libiconv [DONE - see libiconv-win-build]
    3. libxml2
    4. libxslt
    5. pcre
    6. openssl

Apache projects to deal with later:
    1. apr
    2. apr-util
    3. apr-iconv

The real deal:
    1. httpd
